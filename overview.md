# Tutorial: lp20251

This project is a collection of Python **programming exercises**, organized into different files like chapters in a book. Each exercise is a self-contained function that solves a specific problem. The project includes a simple **runner** to easily select and execute any exercise, and also demonstrates core programming concepts like **conditional logic**, **loops**, **data structures**, **input validation**, and even simple **GUI programming**.
