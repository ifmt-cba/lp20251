# Chapter 1: Exercise Runner

Welcome to the tutorial for `lp20251`! In this first chapter, we'll look at a handy tool you'll find at the end of many Python files in this project: the **Exercise Runner**.

Imagine you have a file like `lista2.py` with solutions to 25 different exercises. Each solution is a separate piece of code, usually written inside a function named like `q1`, `q2`, `q3`, and so on, up to `q25`.

How do you tell Python which specific exercise you want to run? Do you have to manually go into the file and type something like `q5()` to run exercise 5, then change it to `q12()` when you want to run exercise 12? That would be tedious!

This is where the **Exercise Runner** comes in. It's a small, smart piece of code right at the very end of the file that makes running individual exercises much easier.

Think of it like a simple menu. When you run the `listaX.py` file, the Exercise Runner asks you which exercise number you want to execute. You type the number, press Enter, and the Exercise Runner finds and runs *just* that exercise's code.

Let's look at the core of the Exercise Runner code, usually found at the very end of files like `lista2.py` or `lista3.py`:

```python
questao = int(input('Quest達o a executar: '))
eval(f'q{questao}()')
```

This is the magic part! Let's break it down:

1.  `input('Quest達o a executar: ')`: This part displays the message "Quest達o a executar: " in your console and waits for you to type something and press Enter. Whatever you type (like `5` or `12`) is read as text.
2.  `int(...)`: The `input` function gives us text. But we want the *number* you typed. The `int()` function takes that text and converts it into a whole number (an integer).
3.  `questao = ...`: This takes the number you typed (converted from text) and stores it in a variable named `questao`. So, if you typed `5`, the `questao` variable now holds the number `5`.
4.  `f'q{questao}()'`: This is a special kind of string called an f-string. It's like a template. The `{questao}` part is replaced by the *value* of the `questao` variable. So, if `questao` is `5`, this f-string becomes the text string `'q5()'`. If `questao` is `12`, it becomes `'q12()'`. This string looks *exactly* like the name of the function we want to call, plus the parentheses `()` needed to call it.
5.  `eval(...)`: This is a powerful Python function. In simple terms, `eval()` takes a string (like `'q5()'`) and tries to execute it as if it were Python code written directly in the file. So, `eval('q5()')` has the same effect as if you had just written `q5()` in your code. `eval('q12()')` has the same effect as writing `q12()`.

**How it works step-by-step when you run the file:**

1.  You open your terminal or command prompt and run the Python file, for example: `python lista2.py`.
2.  Python starts running the code from the top. It defines all the functions (`exemplo_if_else`, `q1`, `q5`, `q9`, etc.).
3.  It reaches the very last two lines, the Exercise Runner code.
4.  The `input()` function runs, printing "Quest達o a executar: " and pausing.
5.  You type `5` and press Enter.
6.  The number `5` is stored in the `questao` variable.
7.  The `eval(f'q{questao}()')` line runs.
8.  Python creates the string `'q5()'`.
9.  `eval()` looks for something named `q5` that can be called, finds the `q5()` function defined earlier in the file, and runs it.
10. The code *inside* the `q5()` function runs.
11. When the `q5()` function finishes, the `eval()` call is complete.
12. Since there is no more code after the Exercise Runner, the program finishes.

This tiny piece of code provides a clean, interactive way to test each exercise solution individually without changing the main file code each time. It acts as a simple dispatcher, routing your request (the exercise number) to the correct function (`qXX`) that contains the solution.

You'll see this pattern repeated in many of the exercise list files (`listaX.py`) and sometimes in other script files like `p1.py`. It's a fundamental part of how you'll interact with the exercise solutions in this project.

In summary, the Exercise Runner is a simple command-line interface at the end of a file that reads an exercise number from you and uses `eval()` to dynamically call the corresponding `qXX` function.

Now that you know how the program starts and how to select which exercise to run, let's dive into what's actually inside those `qXX` functions.
